This is the repo for the latest (Jan 2017) upgrade/redesign of my personal website and portfolio, located at [payamyousefi.com](http://payamyousefi.com/). Happy new year! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Tools/Build information
This website was built via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a parsing engine bundled as a Ruby gem for building static websites using dynamic components. The site also uses other useful gems, including [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io). View the `Gemfile` for more detail. SCSS was compiled by Jekyll's built-in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) preprocessor.
