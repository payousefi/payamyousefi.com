  The "Connect." advertisement series became a year-long campaign for connecting UCSC students with Campus Life resources. Printed as a full back page ad in the bi-weekly UCSC student newspaper, City on a Hill Press.

This project began with a brainstorming session between heads of every Campus Life department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The goal was to develop a campaign that encouraged students to become more involved and aware of the many student resources available. My first contribution was the original coining of the phrase "I connect" &mdash; I believed that a key strategy was using a first-person perspective in the campaign.

With the two keywords in mind, I began designing the ads. I finalized a minimal template for print, with each advertisement standing out through bold color and clear messaging.

The "Connect." advertisement series became a year-long campaign for connecting UCSC students with Campus Life resources. Printed as a full back page ad in the bi-weekly UCSC student newspaper, City on a Hill Press. The "connect" theme is still in constant usage today in new media produced by the Dean of Students office.
