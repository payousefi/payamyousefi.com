"What is my mindset?" is a quiz app built to help teachers assess their mindset by answering a series of "true" or "false" questions. I designed and developed the app to have an engaging, intuitive and rewarding user interface. The interactive flashcard design guides users through questions and presents results in a familiar educational format.

This app was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. SCSS was compiled using the Sass preprocessor, and Angular.js was used as the framework for the quiz functionality. This project was assigned to me as a front end development challenge, to help demonstrate my ability in writing logically organized and appropriately documented code.
