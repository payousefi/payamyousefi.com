Rattlesnake is an interactive stripe generator. I originally created this as a small project to experiment with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. It eventually turned into a fun visual distraction.

The various buttons toggle through number of stripes, stripe widths, as well as different hues, saturation, and brightness levels. A few random clicks can generate a completely unique combination.
