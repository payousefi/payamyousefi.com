I spent a year and a half investigating the mechanisms involved in chromosome segregation during meiosis in *C. elegans*. My research projects included characterizing meiotic checkpoint components by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. I had the opportunity to collaborate with an interdisciplinary team of students and scientists to troubleshoot and solve many challenging problems.

As a member of the Needhi Bhalla lab, I used various molecular biology techniques to genotype and construct *C. elegans* strains for experiments. Some of my projects involved genetic engineering using CRISPR/Cas-9 technology. I also authored bioinformatics scripts to query and identify unique motifs in genomic datasets.

In June 2015, I designed and presented a poster on one of my projects at the 20th International *C. elegans* Meeting in Los Angeles, CA.
