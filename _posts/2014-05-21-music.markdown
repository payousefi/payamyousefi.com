"What kind of music do you like?" — a question I could never answer well. This tool solves that by dynamically presenting my recent listening history in a visual format.

A web app that displays your Last.fm top artists in a beautiful tiled layout. Enter any username to get a shareable, custom URL.

## 2026 Update

Major rewrite with the help of Claude:

- **Vanilla JavaScript** — Removed jQuery dependency entirely
- **Multi-source artist images** — Pulls high-quality images from multiple APIs with adaptive rate limiting and configurable primary source
- **Music Personality** — Generates a unique headline based on listening habits using mood × genre analysis
- **SPA navigation** — History API for smooth, shareable URLs
- **Accessibility improvements** — Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, reduced motion preferences
