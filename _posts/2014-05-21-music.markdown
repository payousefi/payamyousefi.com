  "What kind of music do you like?" — a question I could never answer well. So I built a web app that does it for me: enter any Last.fm username and get a shareable, visual snapshot of your recent listening.

"What kind of music do you like?" — a question I could never answer well. So I built a web app that does it for me: enter any Last.fm username and get a shareable, visual snapshot of your recent listening.

## 2026 Update

Major rewrite with the help of Claude:

- **New backend** — Rebuilt the server with Node.js (goodbye PHP)
- **No dependencies** — Pure vanilla JavaScript, no jQuery
- **Better artist images** — Pulls from four different sources for the best quality
- **AI personality headlines** — Claude writes a creative tagline based on your listening habits
- **Mood-based colors** — The background shifts to match the vibe of your music
- **Smoother experience** — Single-page app with shareable URLs, better security, and full accessibility
