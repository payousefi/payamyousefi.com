  Tumblr is a microblogging social network where users post different types of media, including text, video, gifs, and photosets. Developers can build custom HTML themes using a templating language. I built custom themes for my blog early on, and eventually redistributed my favorites for public use. "Tea Leaves" was one of the most colorful and customizable themes I developed.

Tumblr is a microblogging social network where users post different types of media, including text, video, gifs, and photosets. Developers can build custom HTML themes using a templating language. I built custom themes for my blog early on, and eventually redistributed my favorites for public use. "Tea Leaves" was one of the most colorful and customizable themes I developed.

This theme was designed and developed using basic HTML/CSS. Taking advantage of Tumblr's templating system, I implemented options for custom background images, colors, and navigation styles. The theme supports all of the various media types Tumblr has to offer, and presents them in a minimal and clean design with a large focus on content.
